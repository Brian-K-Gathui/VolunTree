## Key Features:
The following table outlines the core functionalities of **VolunTree**, highlighting how the platform efficiently manages organizations, volunteers, events, and tasks. Each feature is designed to streamline operations, ensuring smooth execution of volunteer-driven charity events with minimal effort from organizations.

| 1  | **Staff-Managed Platform**           | Every aspect of the platformâ€”from registration to task managementâ€”is exclusively managed by VolunTree staff. This ensures precision, care, and seamless execution, allowing organizations and volunteers to focus on making a meaningful impact without logistical worries. |
| 2  | **Organization Registration & Management** | **Registration:** VolunTree staff manage the entire registration process for organizations, collecting essential details such as organization name, contact person, phone number, and email address. <br><br> **Management:** Our team ensures all organization information is accurate and up-to-date, while also assisting in setting up and managing multiple events under a single account. |
| 3  | **Volunteer Registration & Management** | **Registration:** Volunteers can easily sign up through VolunTree, with staff managing the process to create detailed profiles that highlight interests and availability. <br><br> **Management:** Our team matches volunteers to events, maintains communication, and ensures a seamless experience for both volunteers and organizations. |
| 4  | **Event Creation & Management**      | **Creation:** VolunTree staff work closely with organizations to create events, capturing details like event name, date, location, and specific objectives. <br><br> **Management:** From planning to execution, our team oversees every aspect of the event, ensuring smooth logistics, volunteer coordination, and timely completion. |
| 5  | **Task Assignment & Management**     | **Assignment:** VolunTree staff assist organizations in assigning tasks to volunteers, ensuring clear roles and responsibilities. Tasks are tracked with statuses like "pending," "in progress," and "completed." <br> **Management:** Our team monitors task progress, provides support to volunteers, and resolves any issues to keep events on track. |
| 6  | **Comprehensive Entity Management**  | VolunTree staff manage all key entities and their relationships through a centralized system: <br> **Organizations:** Can host multiple events, each with its own tasks and volunteers. <br> **Events:** Linked to one organizer, with multiple volunteers and tasks. <br> **Volunteers:** Can participate in multiple events and handle various tasks. <br> **Tasks:** Assigned to individual volunteers and tied to specific events. |

VolunTree streamlines the entire process, allowing organizations to focus on their mission while we handle the logistics. By partnering with VolunTree, organizations outsource their volunteer-driven charity events to VolunTree, and VolunTree leverages its comprehensive suite of tools to execute these events seamlessly. 
Together, we foster a collaborative environment where organizations can efficiently manage their charity events, and volunteers can engage in meaningful roles, all supported by our committed staff. With VolunTree, organizations can trust that every event will be executed flawlessly, allowing them to achieve their goals without the operational burden.

- **Fetch API** â€“ Handles communication with the backend API.

### **Backend (Server)**
- **Flask** â€“ Lightweight Python framework used for the backend API.
- **Flask-RESTful** â€“ Facilitates building RESTful APIs.
- **Flask-SQLAlchemy** â€“ ORM for handling database operations.
- **Flask-Migrate** â€“ Handles database migrations.
- **Flask-CORS** â€“ Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for API requests.

### **Database**
- **SQLite** â€“ Lightweight relational database for data storage.
- **SQLAlchemy ORM** â€“ Used to interact with the database using Python objects.

### **Development & Deployment**
- **Pipenv** â€“ Dependency management for the backend.
